# Statistics-for-advertising-campaign

In this project I work for an an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of the courses are on web and mobile development, but the company also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc.

The goal of this project is to find the two best markets to advertise an e-learning product in.

After a statiscal exploration of the dataset I have identified that:

US programmers are in majority of attending and paying for courses. On average US students are willing to pay on average around $143.
Canada is coming in as the second possible market based on the average price paid by students ($93). However the relative number of potential customers is quite low (around 6%) while there is twice as many programmers (relatively) from India that are willing to pay on average $66.
In conclusion it is obvious that there should be allocated about 50% of the budget for advertising in the US while it might make sense to split the advertisement for the second market into 25% for Canada and 25% for India and do a follow up to see which market responds best in respect to the advertisements.
